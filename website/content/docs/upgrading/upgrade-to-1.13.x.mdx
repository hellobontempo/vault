# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.13.x compared to 1.12. Please read it carefully.

## Changes

@include 'consul-dataplane-upgrade-note.mdx'

### Active Directory Secrets Engine Deprecation

The Active Directory (AD) secrets engine has been deprecated as of the Vault 1.13 release.
We will continue to support the AD secrets engine in maintenance mode for six major Vault
releases. Maintenance mode means that we will fix bugs and security issues but will not add
new features. For additional information, see the [deprecation table](/vault/docs/deprecation)
and [migration guide](/vault/docs/secrets/ad/migration-guide).

### AliCloud Auth Role Parameter

The AliCloud auth plugin will now require the `role` parameter on login. This
has always been documented as a required field but the requirement will now be
enforced.
